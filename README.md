DAWGo
=====

DAWGo is the home for a particular implementation of a [Directed Acyclic Word
Graph][dawg] in [Go][go]. In fact, the current implementation is closer to a
[Trie][trie] data structure, because common suffixes are shared.

This repository / library was created to support [Shenmeci][shenmeci] in 2013,
and in July 2019 it has been merged into the main project.

No new development is expected to happen here.
